Exercise - Clean Energy Sources in Switzerland
========================
 

Are you interested in which canton in Switzerland boasts the most clean energy sources? You can work with a dataset on renewable power plants from the [Open Power System Data platform](https://open-power-system-data.org/). It lists the power sources currently operating in each canton, grouped into bioenergy, hydro, solar or wind, along with a few more attributes.

If you want some ideas how this type of data can be visualized, hereâ€™s an article where a somewhat similar dataset was used.
