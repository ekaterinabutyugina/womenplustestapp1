Workshop - Build and Deploy Your Simple Python Data App from Scratch
========================

In this hands-on workshop you will learn how to create and deploy 
your very own app, running locally on your computer, 
and explore the possibilities of taking it to the cloud.

## 1) Who is this workshop directed to?

This workshop is for anyone who wants to learn how to build the data applications from scratch without prior front-end knowledge. We will explore how to turn Python data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.

You might be able to relate to one of the following scenarios:

1. You have a business problem (or hackathon challenge) and a lot of raw data. You want to organise this data and create an interactive dashboard to share with stakeholders.

2. Your ML models perform well on your laptop and you want the general public to benefit from it.

3. You want to build your own powerful generative AI app and don‚Äôt know where to start.

4. Ideally you know some basic Python. But if not, we‚Äôll guide you through the learning process step by step. 

## 2) Structure of the Repo 

- Your first step would be to set up your environment and repo, please find the instructions in the [Setting Up](00_setting_up) folder. 
- Then you will experience the "Hello World" of Streamlit, use the same folder.   
- [Livecoding](01_livecoding) is the demo of creating an app from scratch, it might be slightly different from the actual app we deploy.
- For this we might use some additional [Code Snippets](02_snippets).
- [Template Streamlit App](03_template_streamlit_app) folder is the one you can use for the deployment on a Streamlit cloud.
- If time permits or after the workshop let's explore [Clean Energy Sources in Switzerland](04_exercise).

## 3) Optional: Showcase your app ##

- Get acquainted with the vibrant online data visualization community by posting about your app. Include a screenshot of your app and a link to your Github repo.
